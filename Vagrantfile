  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.20"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
  end
  
  
  # Provision VM with Ansible, 
  # http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/intro_getting_started.html
  #
  config.vm.provision :ansible do |ansible|

    # ansible.playbook = "server-meteor-gridkick.yml"
    
    ansible.playbook = "waartaa_playbook.yml"
